# AppraiseJS

#### Test management, re-engineered

Appraisejs is a visual test development, management and execution platform built for the modern day Test Engineers. It is a Nextjs application that runs locally and helps users develop and orchestrate test scenarios without the hassle of learning coding or a new framework.

## Why Appraisejs?

#### Test management, orchestration and execution all in one place without any coding.

- **Test management, orchestration, and execution — all in one place. Without writing code.**
  No glue code. No tool-hopping. No fragile integrations. Everything you need to get started is built in.
- **No-code, but not low-power.**  
Build real, production-grade automation flows visually—without writing a single line of code.
- **User-agnostic by design.**  
QA engineers, manual testers, developers, and even product teams can use AppraiseJS with minimal onboarding and shared understanding.
- **Low configuration, fast setup.**  
One command. Sensible defaults. You’re productive in minutes, not days.
- **Automation without vendor lock-in.**  
AppraiseJS generates real, portable test artifacts (Gherkin, Playwright, Cucumber). You own your tests—always.
- **Visual-first, logic-driven testing.**  
Complex test logic built through composable blocks, not brittle scripts.
- **Framework-level consistency by default.**  
Tests follow a consistent structure, conventions, and execution model—without manual enforcement.
