# Agent MCP Setup

`npm run setup:mcp` is the source of truth for local MCP registration text. Keep this document aligned with that
script instead of hand-maintaining alternate snippets.

## Development Servers

Start the web app plus Streamable HTTP MCP sidecar:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Start only the MCP sidecar:

```bash
npm run dev:mcp
```

Default HTTP endpoint:

```bash
http://127.0.0.1:3010/mcp
```

## Registration

Print current registration details:

```bash
npm run setup:mcp
```

For stdio-only clients, the command shape is:

```bash
appraisejs mcp --cwd <project> --base-url http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

Tool visibility requires registering the current endpoint or stdio command and restarting or reconnecting the MCP
client. Do not report tools as available until the client has completed that refresh.

## Troubleshooting

- `UNAUTHORIZED`: identity exists but the token is not accepted for the current project.
- `project-mismatch`: the client and server fingerprints point at different projects.
- Malformed identity: rerun `appraisejs doctor --json` and recreate local credentials if instructed.
- Endpoint or transport failure: verify web and MCP processes are running and that local sandbox rules allow the bind.
- Missing tools: rerun setup, update the client registration, then restart or reconnect the client.

When reporting validation, distinguish browser/UI approval from backend, service, or MCP approval.
