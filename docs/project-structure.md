# Project Structure

This document explains the repository layout and what each major directory contains.

## Top-Level Folders

- `docs/`: Documentation set (this folder).
- `prisma/`: Prisma schema and migration history; local SQLite database file for dev.
- `scripts/`: Sync and maintenance scripts (run via `npm run <script>`).
- `src/`: Application and test runner source.
- `public/`: Static assets served by Next.js.

Key config files at repo root:

- `package.json`: Scripts and dependencies.
- `cucumber.mjs`: Cucumber configuration (paths, report format).
- `next.config.ts`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `postcss.config.mjs`, `tsconfig.json`: Framework and build config.

## Application Code

- `src/app/`: Next.js App Router pages and layouts.
- `src/actions/`: Server actions for CRUD and orchestration (sync, test runs, reports).
- `src/components/`: Reusable UI components.
- `src/lib/`: Shared libraries (sync helpers, parsers, test runner utilities).
- `src/config/`: Application config (Prisma client, etc).
- `src/constants/`: Form schemas and defaults.
- `src/types/`: Shared TypeScript types.

## Test Assets

- `src/tests/features/`: Gherkin feature files. Some are generated by the UI and include an auto-generated header.
- `src/tests/steps/`: Step definition files with group- and step-level JSDoc used for template step sync.
- `src/tests/config/`: Test runner configuration (environments, World).
- `src/tests/locators/`: Locator JSON files (grouped by module/path).
- `src/tests/mapping/`: Locator map linking routes to locator groups.
- `src/tests/hooks/`: Cucumber hooks that boot Playwright and emit trace metadata.
- `src/tests/support/`: Cucumber support files (custom parameter types).
- `src/tests/reports/`: Generated output (cucumber JSON, logs, traces).

Generated vs authored:

- Authored: feature files (unless auto-generated), step definitions, locator JSON, locator map.
- Generated: reports, logs, traces, and any feature files created by the UI.

## Scripts

- `scripts/`: CLI utilities for syncing filesystem data into the database and other maintenance tasks.
- See [Scripts](scripts.md) and [Syncing](syncing.md).

## Database

- `prisma/schema.prisma`: Full schema for authoring, runs, reports, metrics.
- `prisma/migrations/`: Migration history.
- `prisma/dev.db`: Local SQLite database for development (created via setup/migrate).
