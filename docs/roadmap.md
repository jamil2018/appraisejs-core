- Improve reporting views and drill-downs
- Expand troubleshooting and diagnostics in the UI

## Mid-Term Candidates

- Better conflict resolution flows for locators
- More flexible report retention and cleanup tooling
- Additional test execution controls (filters, retries, scheduling)

## Long-Term Candidates

- Multi-user or hosted deployment support
- External integrations (CI, issue trackers)
- Distributed or remote test execution
